    <p class="b sub">1. GENERAL RULES</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal">
      <li>The start dates and times displayed for E-Sport matches are an indication only and are not guaranteed to be correct. If a match is suspended or postponed, and not resumed within 12 hours from the actual scheduled start time, all bets on the match will be considered void.</li>
      <li>For Outright markets, any bets on whether a team / player advances in a tournament, or wins the tournament, will be considered valid regardless of a suspended or postponed match.</li>
      <li>Should a player / team withdraw before a tournament begins, or retire during a tournament, bets on that player / team to win the tournament, or to advance in tournament, will be considered void.</li>
      <li>If the respective player / team withdraws before the tournament begins while being listed as "must start", then bets on whether a player / team advances in tournament or wins the tournament, will be considered void – this applies to all players / teams listed as participants in the tournament.</li>
      <li>If a match is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the outcome will be considered valid, unless stated in the individual bet type rules below.</li>
      <li>If a match begins before the official confirmed time, all the bets made after the game has started will be considered void, except for In-Play bets.</li>
      <li>If a match ends with a walkover decision, all bets will be considered void.</li>
      <li>All bets stand regardless of changes to map pool, or changes to the number of maps / rounds played.</li>
      <li>If the name of a player / team is misspelled, all bets will stand unless it is obviously the wrong selection.</li>
      <li>If in an official match a player plays with the wrong nickname or on a 'smurf' account, the result is still valid unless it is evident that it is not the player that was supposed to play that match.</li>
      <li>All bets will be settled using the official result as declared by the relevant governing body of the competition concerned.</li>
      <li>The winner of a Counter-Strike match has to win the majority of the rounds that have been scheduled. (For example, if the match was scheduled to play 20 Rounds the winner would be the team / player who won 11 rounds. In the case of a schedule of 24 Rounds the winner would need 13 rounds for victory).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="b sub">2. BET TYPES</p>
    <p>Below is a breakdown of the rules for the individual bet types we offer for E-Sport matches.</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
      <p class="b sub">2.1. Money Line</p>
      <ul style="list-style:decimal">
        <li>Predict who with win the match with the indicated handicap applied. Any form of extra time or overtime will count for settlement purposes. </li>
        <li>If a match is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the outcome will be considered valid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="b sub">2.2. Handicap</p>
      <ul style="list-style:decimal">
        <li>Predict who with win the match with the indicated handicap applied. Any form of extra time or overtime will count for settlement purposes.</li>
        <li>The handicap in an E-Sports match can be Rounds / Maps or other counting measures dependent on the game. The handicap type will only be referred to as the handicap. (For example, in Counter Strike the handicap will be rounds won, while in DotA2 the handicap would be maps).</li>
        <li>Handicap betting In E-Sport matches is done by awarding one of the teams  / players, the underdog, a head start on maps  / rounds. For example:
        	<ul style="list-style:none">
            	<li>Player A -1.5 1.85</li>
                <li>Player B +1.5 2.00</li>
                <li>&nbsp;</li>
                <li>If Player A wins the match by two maps or more, Player A is the winning selection and Player B is the losing selection. If Player A wins by exactly one map or Player B wins, Player B is the winning selection and Player A is the losing selection</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>If a match is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the Handicap market will be considered void.</li>
        <li>If the announced number of maps / rounds is changed, all bets on the Handicap market will be considered void.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="b sub">2.3. Over / Under</p>
      <ul style="list-style:decimal">
        <li>Predict whether the total number of maps / rounds in the match will be over or under the indicated line. Any form of extra time or overtime will count for settlement purposes.</li>
        <li>If a match is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the Over / Under market will be considered void, unless the market is unconditionally determined.</li>
        <li>If the announced number of maps / rounds is changed, all bets on the Over / Under market will be considered void.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="b sub">2.4.	In-Play</p>
      <ul style="list-style:decimal">
        <li>Settlement is based on the final score line after the handicap is applied to a 0-0 score line. The current score, at the time of bet placement, is not factored into the bet.</li>
      </ul>
