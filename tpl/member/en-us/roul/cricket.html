    <p class="b sub">1. GENERAL RULES</p>
            	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                	<li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void.</li>
                    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed and fail to resume after 12 hours from the official kick off / start time, the result as it stands will be deemed void and all bets will be cancelled, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined. The company's decision to cancel all bets in such an event is final and is regardless of any official decision by the event referee or relevant governing authority. </li>
                </ul>
                
            <p class="b sub">2. TEST MATCHES & COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES</p>
            	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                	<li>Bets will stand based on the official result provided at least one ball has been bowled. In the event of a tie, dead heat rules will apply and bets on the draw will be settled as losing bets.</li>
                    <li>If a match is abandoned due to external interference, bets will be considered void. </li>
                    <li>If a match, where the draw is not offered and the result ends in a draw, all bets placed on the match will be considered void.</li>

            <p class="b sub">3. LIMITED OVERS MATCHES </p>
            	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                	<li>In one-day matches, if the match is cut short or abandoned due to external interference, all bets will be settled according to the official competition rules. If the final result is determined by a bowl out, a super-overs or the toss of coin, all bets will be considered void.</li>
                    <li>If the match ends with a draw and the official result or the competition rules do not determine a winner, all bets will be considered void. </li>
                    <li>Where the Duckworth Lewis Method (D/L method) is used, all bets placed on "Highest 10 over Total" and "Highest Opening Partnership" will be considered void, unless the market has been unconditionally determined before the D/L method was implemented.</li>
                    <li>Should a new toss take place on a scheduled reserve day for One Day International, all bets during the last 45 minutes to the start at the original scheduled first day match will be considered void. This rule applies to all markets, except those have been unconditionally determined, such as "Win The Toss"</li>
                </ul>
