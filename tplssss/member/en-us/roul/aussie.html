            	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                	<li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void.</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise stated, all Aussie Rules bets are settled based on the scheduled "80 minutes" play.</li>
                    <li>The term "80 minutes" play includes any stoppage time.</li>
                    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed and fail to resume after 12 hours from the official kick off / start time, the result as it stands will be deemed void and all bets will be cancelled, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined. The company's decision to cancel all bets in such an event is final and is regardless of any official decision by the event referee or relevant governing authority. </li>
                    <li>If a game is abandoned during the 1st half, all 1st half bets are considered void. If a game is abandoned during the 2nd half, all 2nd half bets are considered void, unless otherwise stated in the individual bet type rules. All 1st half bets will still be valid.</li>
                </ul>
