    <p class="b sub"><em>Last Update: 25/9/2012</em></p>
    <p class="b sub">1. GENERAL RULES</p>
            	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                	<li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void.</li>
                    <li>International Baseball Rules: Games will end early if a team is leading by 10 or more runs after the opposing team has batted in at least 7 innings, or if a team is leading by 15 or more runs after the opposing team has batted in at least 5 innings. If this happens, all bets will be considered valid, including Money Line, Odd / Even, Run Line and Total Runs (Over/Under).</li>
                    <li>When betting on the Run Line and Total Runs (over/under) the game must conduct 9 innings (or 8.5 innings, when the 2nd batting team is already ahead) to have a result. If a game is called or suspended in an extra innings, the score will be determined after the last full inning unless the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is called.</li>
                    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed and fail to resume after 12 hours from the official kick off / start time, the result as it stands will be deemed void and all bets will be cancelled, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined. The company's decision to cancel all bets in such an event is final and is regardless of any official decision by the event referee or relevant governing authority. </li>
                    <li>Extra innings count for settlement purposes, unless otherwise specified.</li>
                    <li>1st half betting is based on the result from the 1st to the end of the 5th period.</li>
                    <li>2nd half betting is based on the result from the 6th period to the end of the 9th period. Extra innings count for settlement purposes on 2nd half betting.</li>
                    <li>All Bets placed will remain valid regardless of the starting pitcher.</li>
                    <li>If the game is suspended or cancelled during the 2nd half, all 1st half bets will still be valid.</li>
                    <li>If the game is suspended or cancelled during the 2nd half, all 2nd half bets will be considered void, unless otherwise stated in the individual bet type rules.</li>
                    <li>If the game starts before the scheduled time, only bets placed before the game commenced will be considered valid. Bets placed after the game commenced will be considered void. This excludes In-Play bet types.</li>
                </ul>
