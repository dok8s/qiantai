    <p class="b sub">1. GENERAL RULES</p>
		<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>Unless otherwise stated, all Football bets will be settled based on the scheduled "90 minutes" play.</li>
			<li>The term "90 minutes" play includes any stoppage or injury time. This does not include the extra-time, golden goals, penalty shoot-outs, or a match result which was altered by the official referee or the relevant governing authority after the match.</li>
			<li>All In Play bets will be settled based on the outcome at the end of the scheduled "90 minutes" play, unless otherwise stated in the individual rule for the bet type.</li>
			<li>For certain competitions or friendly matches where the scheduled play is 80 Minutes (2 x 40 minute halves), bets will be settled based on the scheduled time.</li>
			<li>Should there be any youth or friendly matches where play is set for 70 minutes (2 x 35 minute halves) or less, the company will announce before the start of the match. Otherwise all bets on these matches will be considered void.</li>
			<li>If the match is abandoned at anytime within the official 90 minutes of play, all bets will be considered void, unless explicitly stated below or in the individual Bet Type rules.</li>
			<li>If a match is abandoned during the 1st half, all 1st half bets are considered void. If a match is abandoned during the 2nd half, all 2nd half bets are considered void, unless otherwise stated in the individual bet type rules. All 1st half bets will still be valid.</li>
			<li>Own goals are counted for settlement purpose, unless otherwise stated in the individual bet type rules.</li>
			<li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void if the original away team is now the home team.</li>
			<li>For International matches, as long as the change in venue is within same country, all bets are considered valid.</li>
			<li>For International competitions, as long as the venue is within the country or countries where the competition was originally scheduled to be held, all bets are considered valid.</li>
			<li>We reserve the right to void all bets if we think other change of venues scenarios could affect the outcome of the event.</li>

				<p class="b sub">2.1.1. General Rules</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict who will win the match / half / period with the indicated handicap applied.</li>
					<li>A "Handicap" means that a team receives a virtual head start, effectively leading the match by differing goals before it actually begins.</li>
					<li>All bets will be settled by factoring in the indicated handicap applied at the end of the bet type period.</li>
					<li>The favourite team, giving the handicap start, will be allocated the minus handicap and will be highlighted.</li>
					<li>A handicap can be a full goal start (e.g. -1, -2, -3, etc.), a half goal start (e.g. -0.5, -1.5, -2.5, etc.) or a split goal start (e.g. -0/0.5, -0.5/1, -1/1.5, etc.).</li>
			  </ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.1.2. Half Time Handicaps (Asian Handicap)</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>All 1st half bets apply to the first half of play only. Bets are settled on the score at the end of the scheduled "45 minutes" including any injury time.</li>
					<li>If the match is abandoned, suspended, cancelled or aborted for whatsoever reason during the 1st Half, all the first half bets will be considered void.</li>
					<li>If the match is abandoned, suspended, cancelled or aborted for whatsoever reason during the 2nd Half or additional periods, all the first half bets will be considered valid.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.1.3. In-Play Handicap (Also called Running Ball)</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>All bets will be settled by factoring in the indicated handicap applied at the end of the bet type period.</li>
					<li>Settlement is based on the score line, from when the bet was placed to the end of the match / period - i.e. the final score minus the current score of the match. For 1st Half Handicap bets, this is the final score at the end of the 1st Half.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p class="b sub">2.2.   Over / Under Goals</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
				<p class="b sub">2.2.1. General Rules</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict whether the total number of goals will be over or under the indicated goal line.</li>
					<li>If the total number of goals scored is more than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Over'. If the total number of goals scored is less than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Under'.</li>
					<li>All Over / Under bets will be settled by factoring in the indicated handicap applied at the end of the bet type period.</li>
					<li>An Over / Under market line can be a full goal (e.g.  2, 3, 4, etc.), a half goal (e.g. 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc.) or a split goal line (e.g. 1.5/2, 2.5/3, 3.5/4, etc.).</li>
					<li>If a match is abandoned, Over / Under bets will only be settled when the market has been unconditionally determined and any further goals have no affect on the market result. In all other scenarios, bets will be considered void. Please see the examples below:
						<ul style="list-style:lower-alpha">
							<li>Example 1: Member bets Over 2.5 Goals:
								<ul style="list-style:lower-roman">
									<li>The match is abandoned when the score is 2 - 1 </li>

							</li>
							<li>Example 2: Member bets Under 2.5 Goals:
								<ul style="list-style:lower-roman">
									<li>The match is abandoned when the score is 2 - 1 </li>

							<li>Example 3: Member bets Over 3.5 Goals:
								<ul style="list-style:lower-roman">
									<li>The match is abandoned when the score is 2 - 1 </li>

					<li>If the match is abandoned, suspended, cancelled or aborted for whatsoever reason during the 2nd Half or additional periods, all the first half bets will be considered valid.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.2.3. In-Play Over / Under Goals</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Settlement is based on the final score and the goal line at time of bet placement is applied to a 0-0 score line, not the current score line. The current score, at the time of bet placement, is not factored into the bet.</li>
				</ul>
                <p class="b sub">2.2.4. Single Team Over / Under Goals</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">

                    <li>If the total number of goals scored is more than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Over'. If the total number of goals scored is less than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Under'.</li>
                    <li>If a match is abandoned, Single Team Over / Under bets will only be settled when the market has been unconditionally determined and any further goals have no affect on the market result. In all other scenarios, bets will be considered void.</li>

			<p class="b sub">2.40. Offsides</p>
			<p>Below is a breakdown of the rules for the individual offside bet types we offer. </p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
				<p class="b sub">2.40.1. Offsides: General Rules</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>All bets are settled based on the official results made available from the Football authority responsible for organising the match.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.40.2. Offsides: Handicap (Asian Handicap)</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict which team will have the most offsides with the indicated handicap applied through the full "90 minutes" of play, excluding extra time or penalty shoot-outs</li>
					<li>Offsides Handicap is similar to Match Handicap - all bets will be settled by factoring in the indicated handicap applied at the end of the bet type period.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.40.3. Offsides: Over / Under (Total)</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict whether the total number of offsides for both teams will be over or under the indicated line.</li>
					<li>Offsides Over / Under is similar to Match Over / Under - if the total number of offsides made is more than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Over'. If the total number of offsides is less than the indicated line, the market is settled as 'Under'.</li>
					<li>If a match is abandoned, Offside Over / Under bets will only be settled when the market has been unconditionally determined and any further Offsides have no affect on the market result. In all other scenarios, bets will be considered void.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.40.4. First Offside / Last Offside</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict whether the Home or Away team will have the first / last offside in a designated match within the full 90 minutes of play, excluding extra time or penalty shoot-outs.</li>
					<li>If a match is abandoned after the first offside, all bets on the "First Offside" will stand.</li>
					<li>If a match is abandoned after the first offside, all bets on the "Last Offside" will be considered void.</li>
					<li>If a match is abandoned before the first offside, all bets on the "First Offside" and "Last Offside" will be considered void.</li>
					<li>If there are no offsides by either team within the official 90 minutes of play, all bets placed on the "First / Last Offside" markets will be considered void.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="b sub">2.40.5. Time of the First Offside</p>
				<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
					<li>Predict the time in which the first offside will occur in the specific match.</li>
					<li>An example of the selections are:
						<ul style="list-style:lower-alpha">
							<li>Up to and including the 8th Minute</li>
							<li>9th minute onwards</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>For settlement purposes, the 1st minute of the match is from 1 second to 59 seconds. The 2nd minute is from 1 minute to 1 minute 59 seconds and so on</li>
					<li>For example, if a bet is placed on the time of the first offside being between the 1st and the 8th minute and the first offside is at 8 minutes 49 seconds, the bet is a losing bet as this falls within the "9th minute onwards" selection.</li>
					<li>If the match is abandoned after the first offside, all bets on "Time of the First Offside" will be valid.</li>
					<li>If the match is abandoned before the first offside, all bets on "Time of the First Offside" will be considered void.</li>
					<li>If no offside in the full "90 minutes" of play, all bets will be considered void.</li>

					<li>Here is an example:

							<li>Liverpool 6 - 5 Tottenham (Result after 5 penalties each: Liverpool 4 - 4 Tottenham) - the Over / Under line is settled at 8 as this is the total number of penalties scored after each team took 5 penalty kicks.</li>
