    <p class="b sub">General Sports Rules</p>
    <p class="b sub"><em>Last Update: 25/9/2012</em></p>
    <p class="b sub">OVERVIEW</strong></p>
    <p> These rules are intended to define the terms and conditions that apply to all bets accepted by us. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of these rules and the terms upon which your bets are accepted. We reserve the right to amend these rules at any time and any such amendments will then be displayed on this website. Please note that any additional information detailed in the "Announcements"section forms part of the betting rules. In the event of any disparity, please note that any such additional information will supersede our betting rules. </p>
    <p>We consider these rules to be fair and should you require any advice regarding these rules please contact our customer service team. Our team is there to help you and it is in everybody's interest to ensure that queries and disputes are settled as quickly and amicably as possible. The customer service team endeavours to provide prompt and considerate attention to errors and disputes.</p>
    <p>All these rules serve only to establish the general principles that regulate the relationship between the member and the company. In the event of any disagreement it is not the intention of the company to enter into a dispute with the member, but rather to find a solution, whenever possible, for the mutual satisfaction of both parties.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="b sub">1. GENERAL SPORTS RULES</p>
    <p>All bets placed with the company are subject to the following rules and regulations. Any rules listed within individual sports supersede these rules for that particular sport or market:</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>Minimum and maximum bet amounts on all sporting events will be determined by the company and are subject to change without prior written notice.</li>
      <li>The company relies entirely upon the information provided by the customer within their betting account. The company is not responsible for any form of misrepresentation by the customer.</li>
      <li>When betting, members are solely responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your bets for any mistakes before submitting. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. The company does not take responsibility for missing or duplicate bets made by the client. Clients may review their transactions in the "Statement Details" section of the site after each session to ensure all requested bets were accepted.</li>
      <li>In the case of any complaints, the company does not consider valid prints or receipts, which have not been recorded or stored in the company files.</li>
      <li>The company reserves the right to close or suspend a customer's account at anytime.</li>
      <li>The company reserves the right to suspend betting in a market at anytime.</li>
      <li>The company reserves the right to void any bets struck on an event where the outcome is known. Should a bet be placed at an incorrect price due to a delay in the 'Live' coverage of an event, the bets placed during this period of time will be voided, win or lose.</li>
      <li>Information relating to an event (e.g. dates, times, scores, statistics, news, red cards, neutral ground details, etc.) are for general information purposes only.  The company shall not be liable for the accuracy in the information provided.</li>
      <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed and fail to resume after 12 hours from the official kick off / start time, the result as it stands will be deemed void and all bets will be cancelled, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined. The company's decision to cancel all bets in such an event is final and is regardless of any official decision by the event referee or relevant governing authority. For 'Parlays', the bet will still be considered valid, though the selection within the parlay will be considered void. The payout formula will be calculated as (1) for that particular selection.</li>
      <li>Should there be any discrepancies with team names or any other information in other languages, the company will refer to all team names in English.</li>
      <li>The company is not liable, under any circumstances whatsoever, for any discrepancies, damages or loss caused by any of the following incidents:
        <ul style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
          <li>Disruption of service to the com pany's website(s), server(s) or network.</li>
          <li>Loss of data or damaged data on the company's server(s).</li>
          <li>Malicious attack on the company's website(s), server(s) or network by hackers.</li>
          <li>Slow or irregular internet service while accessing the company's website.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>If there is any dispute over the interpretation of any rules or regulation, the company's interpretation will always take precedence.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="b sub">2. RESULTS AND SETTLEMENT</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>The result of an event will be determined on the day of its conclusion for betting purposes unless otherwise stated within the rules for each sport or event. Any subsequent enquiry that may result in an overturned decision will not be recognised by the company after 72 hours from the processing of the result. Within 72 hours after results are processed, the company will only reset / correct the results due to human error, system error or mistakes made by the referring results source.</li>
      <li>Markets are usually settled at the end of the event. However, in the interest of the member, some markets may be settled before the official result is declared. These are markets that are unconditionally determined and can include certain markets for events that are abandoned, suspended or postponed. The company reserves the right to reverse settlement in the event a market is settled in error.</li>
      <li>Results will be determined by the company by using official sources from each sport's governing body.</li>
      <li>For the purpose of settling bets, the company shall take the latest back-up data on bets placed. The company will not entertain any complaints or disputes, unless the customer can produce a printed copy of the betting transaction(s). Otherwise, the company's transaction record shall be deemed as final.</li>
    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed, only bets placed on markets that have been unconditionally determined will be consider valid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="b sub">3. IN-PLAY / IN-RUNNING RULES</p>
    In-Play is where it is possible to bet during an ongoing game or event. Bets will be accepted once the game or event begins and will cease once the game or event is taken off the odds display. A variety of different markets can appear during the duration of a game.<br />
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>Bets placed In-Play can be kept in a pending state during specific danger moments in a game or event. This is known as 'Danger Mode'. An example of danger moments include:
        <ul style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
          <li>Penalty Kick.</li>
          <li>Free Kick in a dangerous position.</li>
          <li>Corner Kick / Throw-in that is in an advanced position (Football).</li>
          <li>Whenever a team is in a potential scoring scenario or in an active attacking area.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a bet is placed when a market is in 'Danger Mode', the word 'Pending' will be shown on the bet receipt. This means that the bet has not been accepted or declined yet. If the period of danger passes with no significant occurrence in the game or event, the bet will be confirmed.</li>
      <li>Pending bets will be cancelled if a goal is scored or any event occurs that significantly affects the market, e.g. a Red Card.</li>
      <li>In the case of In-Play, the company will enforce the following conditions in order to ensure that bets are placed at the correct time, at the correct price and under the correct circumstances, as determined by us:
        <ul style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
          <li>The time in which a goal / point is scored is determined solely by the company. We will not entertain any references as to the time that a goal / point is scored as stated in official league / club websites, media websites or "live score" websites.</li>
          <li>If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a bet (or bets) has been placed after an event has taken place in the game / event, we reserve the right to cancel such bet(s) without having to provide any reason or burden of proof.</li>
          <li>In the event that the company website cannot be accessed to update the score, odds or handicap-goal line, the company reserves the right to cancel all pending bets placed at the time of the incident.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="b sub">4. ISSUES RELATING TO TIMES</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>If an event starts before its scheduled time, only bets placed before the event starts will be considered valid. All bets placed after the start of the game will be considered invalid or void, except for In-Play bets.</li>
      <li>For events where injury or stoppage time is played, this is deemed to be part of regular time.</li>
      <li>Overtime will only count where stated in the individual sport rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="b sub">5. DEAD HEAT RULES</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>For markets where there is a dead heat with two or more winning selections, the winnings will be reduced. This reduction is calculated by multiplying the stake by the number of expected winners and dividing it by the number of selections that dead heat. This reduced stake is then multiplied by the original odds to calculate the winnings. This part of the stake is returned and the rest of the stake is lost.</li>
      <li>Example: If three selections dead heat, stake placed on each of the three selections is divided by three. Winnings are paid on one third of the stake, with this portion of the stake returned. The remaining two thirds of the member's stake is lost.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="b sub">6. CHANGE OF VENUE</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>If a scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void if the original away team is now the home team.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to void all bets if we think other change of venues scenarios could affect the outcome of the event, e.g. Tennis change of surface.</li>
      <li>In certain situations, we may not void the bets. This can include tournaments where both selections were originally considered to be playing at a neutral venue and the change of venue has no impact.</li>
      <li>The individual sport's rules will override these rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="b sub">7. ERRORS</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>While the company makes every effort to ensure that errors are not made, we reserve the right to void a bet if there is a clear error. This includes, but is not limited to:</li>
      <ul style="list-style:lower-alpha">
        <li>Incorrect prices, which are clearly different from those available in the general market.</li>
        <li>Incorrect handicaps, Over / Unders, Totals, Lines, Spreads, etc.</li>
        <li>Incorrect fixtures, dates and times.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>We will endeavour to contact the customer when we void bets in this instance, if possible. The information will also be relayed in our Announcements section.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="b sub">8. IRREGULAR BETS</p>
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
      <li>Any member who the company suspects of cheating or damaging our platform will have their bets voided and their account suspended without warning or notification. This includes the use of forbidden artificial intelligence equipment.</li>
    </ul>
     </ul>
